*** Notes ***
- TC001 Sign Up Account: I have used registered email for testdata, so it shows 'Registered Failed'
- I have used one Sleep syntax at Page Keyword 'Click Add Cart Button' at search_result_page.robot. I am not sure if it is a bad practice, but without using sleep (using only Wait Until... keyword), the OK button will not be clicked
